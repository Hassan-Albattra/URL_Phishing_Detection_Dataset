# URL Phishing Detection Dataset
A curated dataset for machine learning and deep learning–based phishing URL detection
## Overview
The URL Phishing Detection Dataset is a cleaned, structured, and research-ready dataset designed to support the development of machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid-based cybersecurity models. Phishing URLs continue to be one of the most prevalent attack vectors, enabling cybercriminals to steal credentials, financial data, and personal information. Building reliable predictive models requires large, diverse, and well-balanced datasets, which are often difficult to obtain or contain noisy samples.

This repository provides a high-quality, labeled dataset that combines real-world phishing examples with legitimate URLs, enabling researchers and practitioners to train and evaluate classification models effectively.
